title: Summary of introduction to Machine Learning in Production
comments: true

in machine learning understanding the theory is vital but it's not the end of journey, it's only the start.
as a machine learning engineer you have to put your system in production which is a long unpaved road. in this blogpost we discuss the summary of the first course in the machine learning in production specilization offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

machine learning is more than just a <b> proof of concept </b> code in your jupyter notebook. you have to eventually deploy for users to use. so to put things into prespective how much is the gap between the POC code and the production?
the gap actually is quite large. the POC code is just 5-10% of the whole code you have to write
let's take a peek of the other components that are in an ML infrastructure

just as software engineers have [SDLC](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-sdlc.html#:~:text=The%20Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle%20(SDLC)%20is%20a%20structured%20process,all%20customer%20expectations%20and%20demands.]) to help them with the production process we also have  Machine Learning development Lifecycle.
