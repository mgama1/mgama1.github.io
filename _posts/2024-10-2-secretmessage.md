title: "Hiding in plain sight: An introduction into Steganography and cryptography"
---

More than 24 centuries ago, a Greek ruler named Histiaeus needed to send a secret message to his ally, Aristagoras. A pigeon wasn't going to cut it, so he got a little creative. He summoned his most loyal slave, shaved the manâ€™s head, and wrote the message on his scalp. After bandaging the slave's head, Histiaeus waited until the hair grew back, then sent him on his way to deliver the message.


This unusual method of concealing a message is considered the first recorded use of steganography. From that point onward, our methods only grew more creative. As new forms of media emerged, the techniques for hiding messages in plain sight hasevolved right alongside them.

Since then we have come a long way, from hiding messages on a literal man's head to writing with invisible ink (thankfully on paper) or encapsulating the secret message in the first letter of every word, more generally known as null cipher

But what if you don't have a slave to write on his head or can't craft a seemingly innocent essay that perfectly fits the message in its correct place?
Well you are in luck
